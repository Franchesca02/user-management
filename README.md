Tech Stack
Vite (for fast development and build)
React (with TypeScript)
React Icons for UI icons
React Toastify for notifications
Tailwind CSS for styling

Note: React + TypeScript + Vite
This project uses React + TypeScript powered by Vite for fast development with Hot Module Replacement (HMR).
Currently, two official plugins are available:

@vitejs/plugin-react uses Babel for Fast Refresh.
@vitejs/plugin-react-swc uses SWC for Fast Refresh.
This project uses @vitejs/plugin-react for optimal development experience.

Configure PaserOption..
export default tseslint.config({
  languageOptions: {
    // other options...
    parserOptions: {
      project: ['./tsconfig.node.json', './tsconfig.app.json'],
      tsconfigRootDir: import.meta.dirname,
    },
  },
})

Install React ESLINT Plugin
// eslint.config.js
import react from 'eslint-plugin-react'

export default tseslint.config({
  // Set the React version
